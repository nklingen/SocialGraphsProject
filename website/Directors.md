We see that Paul Feig has not only the highest avergage rating, but had also directed the most episodes (15 total episodes), nearly 8% of the entire show, from seasons, particularly in seasons 2, 4, and 5. He then returned in season 6 to direct `Niagra Parts 1 and 2`, and in season 7 to direct `Goodbye, Michael`. As previously discussed, these three episodes were amongst the most popular of the entire show. Moreover, he directed `Dinner Party` - which is supposedly Steve Carell's favorite episode - as well as `Goodbye, Toby`.
