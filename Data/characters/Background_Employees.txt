===Pilot employees===
[[File:pilotemployees.jpg|left|400px]]
Early on in the show, they had not yet established their supporting cast. In [[Pilot|the pilot]], four office workers are seen that are never seen or heard from again. It is possible they were fired, went to work at a different branch, or left after hearing rumors of downsizing. It's possible these actors represent roles that were later recast, similar to Meredith below, such as Devin and Louanne (neither of whom appeared in the pilot).

The male employee is played by [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1937615/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 Mike McCaul].

The red-haired woman is Meredith Palmer, played by [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0544055/ Henriette Mantel] in the pilot. (The role was subsequently recast.){{OfficeLadiesCitation001|11:00}} Footage of Mantel [[:File:Henriette Mantel (Hot Girl).png|walking to a filing cabinet]] was used in the final scene of "[[Hot Girl]]", though she is in the same clothing as the pilot.
