DTU Social Graphs Project

The first part of the final project is a 2 minute movie, which should explain the central idea/concept that you will investigate in your final project. You're making the movie so that the TAs, Anna, and I can give you feedback, and so that other groups can 'steal' your ideas (and you can steal ideas from them). The movie must contain the following:

- [ ] An explanation of the central idea behind your final project (what is the idea?, why is it interesting?)
- [ ] Which datasets did you need to explore the idea? how did you download them ?
  - [Dunderpedia: The Office Wiki](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)
  - [Every line from the office, including deleted scenes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wS5AAwOh8QO95RwHLS95POmSNKA2jjzdt0phrxeAE0/edit#gid=747974534
  - Character Relations based on number of lines exchanged)
  - [Kaggle Dataset of viewership and ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/andreal314159/the-office-analysis-for-datacamp/data.) What are the ratings over time ? How did michael leaving affect the show ratings ?
- [ ] An outline on the elements you'll need to get to your goal & the implementation plan..
- [ ]  A walk-through of your preliminary data-analysis, addressing
  - What is the total size of your data? (MB, number of pages, other variables, etc.)
  - What is the network you will be analyzing? (number of nodes? number of links?, degree distributions, what are node attributes?, etc.)

But other than that, there are no constraints on the video format. And we do appreciate funny/inventive/beautiful movies, although the academic content is most important. Note that we'll display the movie to the entire class.

Handing in the assignment: Simply upload your video to youtube (the higher the resolution the better) and submit the link to peergrade.
Note that since Project Assignment A now requires significant data-work, you have 2 weeks to create the video presentation.
